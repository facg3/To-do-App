# To-do-App
## What
We built our to-do app using TDD. Our app helps people enter tasks they need to do into a web page so that they don't forget them. It also allows them view the tasks they have added in a list so that I can plan their day. The app helps people mark tasks as complete so that they can focus on the tasks they have left.

## Why  

This app helps people to organize their chores in the day-to-day life.

## How  
We divided the functions on the three of us so that each two do pair programming while the third searches/prepares the upcoming part. And then we swap pairs till we get everything done.
